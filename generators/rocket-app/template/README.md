# FicusJS and Rocket Starter Kit

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside your project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rocket.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ site
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.rocket.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ public
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Rocket looks for `.rocket.md` or `.rocket.js` or `.rocket.html` files in the `site/pages` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `site/src/components/`, but that's where we like to put our web components.

Any static assets, that is not referenced via HTML but you still want to be on the web server we can place in the `site/public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
